/**
  * This class functions like a standard <code>InputStream</code> except that it
  * counts line numbers, and canonicalizes newline characters.  As data
  * is read, whenever the byte sequences "\r", "\n", or "\r\n" are encountered,
  * the running line count is incremeted by one.  Additionally, the whatever
  * line termination sequence was encountered will be converted to a "\n"
  * byte.  Note that this class numbers lines from 0.  When the first
  * line terminator is encountered, the line number is incremented to 1, and
  * so on.
  * <p>
  * This class counts only line termination characters.  If the last line
  * read from the stream does not end in a line termination sequence, it
  * will not be counted as a line.
  * <p>
  * Note that since this class operates as a filter on an underlying stream,
  * it has the same mark/reset functionality as the underlying stream.  The
  * <code>mark()</code> and <code>reset()</code> methods in this class handle line numbers
  * correctly.  Calling @code{reset()} resets the line number to the point
  * at which <code>mark()</code> was called if the subordinate stream supports
  * that functionality.
  * <p>
  * This class is deprecated in favor if <code>LineNumberReader</code> because
  * it operates on ASCII bytes instead of an encoded character stream.  This
  * class is for backward compatibility only and should not be used in
  * new applications.
  *
  * @deprecated
