/**
 * A resouce bundle contains locale-specific data.  If you need
 * localized data, you can load a resource bundle that matches the
 * locale with <code>getBundle</code>.  Now you can get your object by
 * calling <code>getObject</code> or <code>getString</code> on that
 * bundle.
 * <br>
 * When a bundle is demanded for a specific locale, the ResourceBundle
 * is searched in following order (<i>def. language code<i> stands for
 * the two letter ISO language code of the default locale (see
 * <code>Locale.getDefault()</code>).
 * <pre>
 * baseName_<i>language code</i>_<i>country code</i>_<i>variant</i>
 * baseName_<i>language code</i>_<i>country code</i>
 * baseName_<i>language code</i>
 * baseName_<i>def. language code</i>_<i>def. country code</i>_<i>def. variant</i>
 * baseName_<i>def. language code</i>_<i>def. country code</i>
 * baseName_<i>def. language code</i>
 * baseName
 * </pre>
 * The bundle is backed up by the bundles appearing below in the above
 * list.  That means, that if a resource if missing in the bundle,
 * the back up bundles are searched for the resource.
 * <br>
 * If you provide a bundle for a given locale, say
 * <code>Bundle_en_UK_POSIX</code>, you must also provide a bundle for
 * all sub locales, ie. <code>Bundle_en_UK</code>, <code>Bundle_en</code>, and
 * <code>Bundle</code>.
 * <br>
 * When a bundle is searched, we look first for a class with
 * the given name and if that is not found for a file with
 * <code>.properties</code> extension in the classpath.  The name
 * must be a fully qualified classname (with dots as path separators).  
 * <br>
 * (Note: This implementation always backs up the class with a
 * properties file if that is existing, but you shouldn't rely on
 * this, if you want to be compatible to the standard JDK.)
