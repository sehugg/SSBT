/**
 * A Dictionary maps keys to values; <i>how</i> it does that is
 * implementation-specific.
 * 
 * This is an abstract class which has really gone by the wayside.
 * People at Javasoft are probably embarrassed by it.  At this point,
 * it might as well be an interface rather than a class, but it remains
 * this poor, laugable skeleton for the sake of backwards compatibility.
 * At any rate, this was what came before the <pre>Map</pre> interface 
 * in the Collections framework.
