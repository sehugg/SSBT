/**
 * This class can be viewed under to aspects.  You can see it as a
 * vector of bits or as a set of nonnegative integers.  The name
 * <code>BitSet</code> is a bit misleading.
 *
 * It is implemented by a bit vector, but its equally possible to see
 * it as set of nonnegative integer; each integer in the set is
 * represented by a set bit at the corresponding index.  The size of
 * this structure is determined by the highest integer in the set.
 *
 * You can union, intersect and build (symmetric) remainders, by
 * invoking the logical operations and, or, andNot, resp. xor.
 *
 * This class is thread safe, in the sense, that every method acts as
 * if it were atomic.
