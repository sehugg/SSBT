    Interface for objects that can be ordering among other
    objects. The ordering can be <EM>total</EM>, such that two objects
    only compare equal if they are equal by the equals method, or
    <EM>partial</EM> such that this is not necessarily true. For
    example, a case-sensitive dictionary order comparison of Strings
    is total, but if it is case-insensitive it is partial, because
    "abc" and "ABC" compare as equal even though "abc".equals("ABC")
    returns false.
