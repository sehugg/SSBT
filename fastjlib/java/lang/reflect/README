README for java.lang.reflect:


Jun 20 1998 - John Keiser - initial revision, 1.1.0

OK, the Java side was easy.

The difficult part is the native side, and while that has gone somewhere, there
is so much integration between the VM and class libraries in Sun's version that
a whole new API had to be created (the VMI being the prominent one).  JCL
Reflection will likely never work with Sun's JDK 1.1 unless we manage some real
magic.  Therefore I am targeting it to Japhar and Kaffe 1.1, where we at least
have some ability to create VMI functionality.

I am not even certain if Sun's JDK 1.2 will be able to support JCL Reflection.
I am not getting my hopes up.  Unless their JVMDI spec improves, it will be
impossible to do so efficiently, and probably impossible in any case, without
knowing their internal structures so that we can .

This whole thing has been compiled but has never run.  I am checking this in
right now so that Geoffrey Berry, who is working on Serialization, will have
some starting points, especially in regards to his native code.
