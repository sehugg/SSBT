/**
 ** Method is a class which represents a method.
 ** You may get information about it and make calls on it.<P>
 **
 ** <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> This class returns and accepts types as Classes, even primitive types; there are Class
 ** types defined that represent each different primitive type.  They are <code>java.lang.Boolean.TYPE,
 ** java.lang.Byte.TYPE, </code>etc.  These are not to be confused with the classes
 ** <code>java.lang.Boolean, java.lang.Byte</code>, etc., which are real classes.<P>
 **
 ** <STRONG>Serialization:</STROMG>Note that this is not a serializable class.  It is entirely feasible to make it
 ** serializable, but this is on Sun, not me.<P>
 **
 ** <STRONG>Access and Security:</STRONG> Once this Method is created by java.lang.Class (which does its own
 ** security check), any object may query it for information like parameter types, exception types, etc.
 ** However, the Method may only be invoked using standard Java language access controls.  The JLS says that
 ** reflective access to all private, public and protected reflective members is granted to any class which
 ** can be linked against the reflected member.  Link-level enforcement is the enforcement of public, private,
 ** protected and default access rules, based on the caller's relationship to the class (same package,
 ** subclass, or unrelated).  Thus, if you couldn't normally invoke this method from the calling class, you
 ** can't do it using a Method object either.<P>
 **
 ** The relevant section of the VM spec on link-security is <A
 ** HREF='http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/html/Concepts.doc.html#22574'>2.16.3</A>, under Resolution.
 ** A summary of the appropriate rules follows.<P>
 **
 ** <STRONG>Summary of access rules</STRONG><BR>
 ** Two checks are done, and they are the same checks--on both the member's class and the member itself:
 ** <UL>
 ** <LI>If the caller is the same class as the member's class, then it can access the member no matter
 ** what.</LI>
 ** <LI>If the caller is in the same package as the member's class, then the member's class and the member
 ** itself must both be public, protected or default access.</LI>
 ** <LI>If the caller is a subclass of the member's class, then the member's class and the member itself must
 ** both be public or protected access.</LI>
 ** <LI>If the caller is in the same package as the member's class, then the member's class and the member must
 ** be public access.</LI>
 ** </UL>
 ** <P>
 **
 ** As far as I can tell from the fairly confusing <A
 ** HREF='http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/docs/guide/innerclasses/spec/innerclasses.doc.html'>Inner
 ** Classes Specification</A>, there should be no change to these rules from the addition of inner
 ** classes in 1.1.<P>
 **
 ** <STRONG>Version note:</STRONG> In 1.2, the security checks can be disabled in the AccessibleObject
 ** interface.  But this ain't 1.2. :)<P>
 **
 ** <STRONG>BUGS:</STRONG> The maximum size of a signature right now is 4096 characters because I'm using
 ** a static buffer when I calculate them.  While fine for most purposes, it is for pathological cases that
 ** specs are built.  I'm not sure how I'll handle this yet.
