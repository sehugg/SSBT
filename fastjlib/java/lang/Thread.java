/**
 ** Thread represents a single thread of execution in the VM.
 ** When an application VM starts up, it creates a new Thread
 ** which calls the main() method of a particular class.  There
 ** may be other Threads running, such as the garbage collection
 ** thread.<P>
 **
 ** Threads have names to identify them.  These names are not
 ** necessarily unique.<P>
 **
 ** Every Thread has a priority, as well, which tells the VM
 ** which Threads get more running time.<P>
 **
 ** There are two methods of creating a Thread: you may
 ** subclass Thread and implement the <CODE>run()</CODE> method, at which
 ** point you may start the Thread by calling its <CODE>start()</CODE>
 ** method, or you may implement <CODE>Runnable</CODE> in the class you
 ** want to use and then call new <CODE>Thread(your_obj).start()</CODE>.
 **
 ** @specnote it is unclear at what point a Thread should be added to a
 **           ThreadGroup, and at what point it should be removed.
 **           Should it be inserted when it starts, or when it is
 **           created?  Should it be removed when it is suspended or
 **           interrupted?  The only thing that is clear is that the
 **           Thread should be removed when it is stopped.
